    title: "How do the contests work",
    content:
      "Each contest on Thebes is structured into multiple stages, starting with Stage Zero, which serves as a preliminary round. During this stage, creators submit their entries within a specified period. Once submissions close, the voting phase begins, allowing the audience to vote for their favorites. After the voting period ends, the top-ranked creators advance to the next stage, bringing them one step closer to winning the contest. Each subsequent stage follows a similar format, culminating in a final showdown where the ultimate winners are decided.",
